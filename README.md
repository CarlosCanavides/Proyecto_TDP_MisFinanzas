## General info
This app is part of a project for **Programming Technology** subject at Universidad Nacional del Sur.
The objective of this project is to put into practice the knowledge acquired in this subject.
The proposal is an application that allows you to record transactions (expenses or income) to control your personal finances with ease and efficiency.

## Demo version
Unfortunately this application is not published in the Google Play Store, since it needs to be optimized and add a couple of details. However, a demo version is available.

**You can download the demo version at [Expenses App](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17dgRZNjiGMZjRo9LVwWUfJt-XWlTr5kx/view?usp=sharing)**

## Technologies
The main technology I used was [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). Then I also used [Material Design](https://material.io/) to design the interface.
